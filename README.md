### _**Level 3, Task 12: Semantic Similarity (NLP)**_
#### _**Compulsory Task 2**_

#### *Project Description*
For this project we were asked to create a program with a function that suggested to the user a new movie based on the levels of similarity its description had to the description of movie the user just watched, *"Planet Hulk"*, using the similarity function of the spaCy module. The function was to take the description of *"Planet Hulk"* as a parameter and then return the title of the movie description that had the highest level of similarity to it. The movies to be compared against *"Planet Hulk"* were given to us in a file called "movies.txt" which I have included in this repo. 

#### *Installation* 
In order to run this program on your computer you need the following:
* Python
* A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code
* Python's spaCy module

#### *Usage*
This program was create to test my understanding of how the similarity function of spaCY works and how it tights into the field of Natural Language Processing

#### *Credit*
A lot of the credit for this program goes to my mom who helped me get started on this program, I was confused on where to start (and also running on four hours of sleep) and also didnt fully understand what I was being asked to do. So thank you mom!
